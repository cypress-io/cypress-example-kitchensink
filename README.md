# Kitchen Sink [![renovate-app badge][renovate-badge]][renovate-app] [![semantic-release][semantic-image] ][semantic-url]

This is an example app used to showcase [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) End-to-End (E2E) testing. The application demonstrates the use of most [Cypress API commands](https://on.cypress.io/api). Additionally this example app is configured to run E2E tests in various CI platforms.
Several workflows demonstrate the CI use of [Cypress Docker images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images) which provide convenient, pre-configured compatible environments for Cypress.
The [tests](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink/tree/master/cypress/e2e) are also heavily commented.

To see the kitchen sink application, and to view the [Cypress API commands](https://on.cypress.io/api) demonstrated by the app, visit [example.cypress.io](https://example.cypress.io/).

## CI Status

The following table lists live workflows from various CI providers. These each independently test the contents of this example repository. They run and record using [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction) with their results displaying centrally under Cypress Cloud [ProjectId `4b7344`](https://cloud.cypress.io/#/projects/4b7344/runs). Each CI provider shows its build status on its own site:

## CI Workflow Examples

This table shows additional examples of CI workflows. With the exception of GitHub Actions workflows, these are **not** live examples as in the table above and they may require modification before use. The GitHub Actions workflows are live and they run without recording to Cypress Cloud.

The Cypress documentation page [CI Provider Examples](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/ci-provider-examples) provides some more examples with extensive guides for using Cypress with some of the most popular CI providers.

## Run Tests

### Local testing

To run the tests from this repo on your local machine, first make sure your machine meets the [Cypress System Requirements](https://on.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements), including the installation of [Node.js](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Installing-Nodejs) according to the version specified in the file [.node-version](./.node-version).

Executing the following instructions will clone the repository, install dependencies and run Cypress:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink.git
cd cypress-example-kitchensink
npm ci # install dependencies
npm run local:run # run Cypress headlessly
```

`local:run` is a [package.json](./package.json) script that starts a local webserver and then uses [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) to run Cypress headlessly.
If you would like to run Cypress tests interactively, then run the following command which uses [cypress open](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) to run Cypress in headed mode. You can pick individual tests to run.

```shell
npm run local:open
```

As an alternative to using the `local:open` and `local:run` scripts, you can also start the server in one step and then run Cypress in a second step.

```shell
npm start # start server on port 8080
```

You can check that the server is running if you open a web browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).

Then in a separate terminal window execute either

```shell
npx cypress run # for headless mode
```

or

```shell
npx cypress open # for headed interactive mode
```

#### Script and server structure

The scripts `local:run` and `local:open` use the `start-test` alias of the npm module [start-server-and-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/start-server-and-test) to run [./scripts/start.js](./scripts/start.js), which starts the webserver, waits for it to become ready, and then launches Cypress.

The `start` script spawns a webserver using the npm module [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) and displays the Kitchen Sink App on port `8080`.

### CI Testing

If you would like to try out running tests in a Continuous Integration (CI) provider then you need to first [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) so that you have your own copy. Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#configuring-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-upstream-repository) to set up aliases for `remote upstream` (to this repo) and `remote origin` (to your fork) correctly.
You will also need to have an account with the CI provider you want to test with.
