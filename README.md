# Cypress Interview

This is a small app for cypress interview purposes. You'll have to complete all tasks in a given time.
Please create a separate branch before you start coding.
At the end create a pull request.
Good luck!

### Set up this repo
```bash
## install the node_modules
npm install

## start the local webserver
npm start
```

The `npm start` script will spawn a webserver on port `8080` which hosts the Kitchen Sink App.

You can verify this by opening your browser and navigating to: [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

```bash
## launch the cypress test runner
npm run cy:open
```

**shortcut:** you can use command `npm run local:open` that uses [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) to start local server and open Cypress. When you close Cypress, the local server is stopped automatically. Similarly you can use `npm run local:run` to start the server, run Cypress tests headlessly and close the server.
