template.description: "2:After you click **Deploy**, your app will be deployed to IBM Cloud.\n\nYour app's code will be automatically loaded into a Git repo. Each time you commit changes to the repo, they are automatically deployed by using a toolchain that is associated with your app. You can add more tools to the toolchain and share it with your team. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/getting-started).\n\nThe toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected organization, when you click **Deploy**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected."
