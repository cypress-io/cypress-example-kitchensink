  pre:
    ## runs the 'start' script which
    ## boots our local app server on port 8080
    ## which cypress expects to be running
    - npm start:
        background: true
  override:
    ## lint source files
    - npm run lint
    ## and if any of the files changed
    ## we should stop the build - someone forgot to
    ## check in linted source files!
    - $(npm bin)/stop-build
    ## now run cypress headlessly
    ## and record all of the tests.
    ## Cypress will search for a
    ## CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY environment
    ## variable by default and apply
    ## this to the run.
    - $(npm bin)/cypress run --record

    ## alternatively we could specify
    ## a specific record key to use
    ## like this without having to
    ## configure environment variables
    ## - cypress run --record --key <your_record_key>
